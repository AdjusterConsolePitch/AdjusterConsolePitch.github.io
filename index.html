            <p>At AdjusterConsole, our mission is to solve the most common pain points in the claims industry through ingenuity and the simplification of tasks. We aim to streamline claims processing by standardizing data entry, ensuring consistency in note-taking, and increasing accuracy and compliance. By placing essential information at adjusters’ fingertips, we reduce the risk of errors and speed up decision-making, allowing your team to focus on higher-value tasks.

        <div class="text-block slide-in">
            <h3>Automated SOPs to Ensure Consistency and Compliance</h3>
            <p>Each company's Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are critical for maintaining consistency and compliance. Our program takes this a step further by codifying your company's specific SOPs into automated subroutines, ensuring that every claim is handled in accordance with your established rules—without exception. Adjusters follow a simple input process, and the program guides them step-by-step to ensure nothing is missed.</p>
            <p>This not only boosts accuracy but also ensures your company adheres to internal compliance and industry standards, reducing costly errors and the need for rework.</p>

            <h3>Customization to Fit Every Adjuster’s Workflow</h3>
            <p>Every company has unique needs, and our program provides the flexibility to meet them. It offers a fully customizable interface where everything from button appearance to note output formatting can be modified to suit your team’s preferences. Users can even create their own custom buttons allowing adjusters to further tailor the program to their specific tasks.</p>
            <p><strong>Customizable Appearance:</strong> Adjust the size, position, output, and text display of buttons.</p>
			<p><strong>Tailored Operation:</strong> Modify the functionality and outputs for any task to align with company-specific SOPs.</p>
            <p><strong>Scalable Across Teams:</strong> Whether you have 15 adjusters or 15,000, the program scales seamlessly across your organization.</p>
            <p>This level of customization ensures that the program integrates smoothly into existing workflows while enhancing overall efficiency. Savings scale linearly—the more adjusters using the system, the more time and resources saved.</p>

        <h3>Estimate Your Savings vs Cost</h3>
        <p>Enter the number of employees to see how much you could save:</p>
        <input type="number" id="employees" placeholder="Number of Employees" min="50" step="50"><br>
        <button id="calculateBtn">Calculate Savings</button>
        <p id="result"></p>
        <p>We have nothing to hide! This calculation assumes a modest 7.5% increase in productivity for a worker earning $24/hour, working 40 hours a week. Actual savings may vary based on factors such as employee pay rates, existing procedures, and the complexity of tasks.</p>
	    <p>However, as users gain experience, the efficiency gains will likely be even higher. This estimate is a starting point and we typically expect results to steadily improve over time and exceed this estimate.</p>
